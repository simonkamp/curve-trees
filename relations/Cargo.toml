[build]
 # Adds architecture specific optimizations including those enabling the asm backend for ark_ff. It could potentially cause slowdowns from other features.
rustflags = "-C target-cpu=native"
 # You could alternatively add support for the asm backend through "-C target-feature=+bmi2,+adx", but the binary would only run on systems supporting these instructions.
