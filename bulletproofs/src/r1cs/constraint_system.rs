/// The interface for a constraint system, abstracting over the prover
/// and verifier's roles.
///
/// Statements to be proved by an [`R1CSProof`](::r1cs::R1CSProof) are specified by
/// programmatically constructing constraints.  These constraints need
/// to be identical between the prover and verifier, since the prover
/// and verifier need to construct the same statement.
///
/// To prevent code duplication or mismatches between the prover and
/// verifier, gadgets for the constraint system should be written
/// using the `ConstraintSystem` trait, so that the prover and
/// verifier share the logic for specifying constraints.

/// when the challenges can be sampled to create randomized constraints.

    /// to `specify_randomized_constraints`, which implements
