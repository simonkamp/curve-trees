# Full security through PRF
The coins are commitments in the curve $E_{even}$. $E_{even}$ and $E_{odd}$ form a 2-cycle.

A public key is a rerandomizable commitments to PRF key: $$C_{sk} = [sk] \cdot G + [r_{sk}] \cdot H_{odd} $$

### Minting
When minting a coin to a receiver with public key $C_{sk}$:
- Let $C^*_{sk} = C_{sk}+r_{rerandomization}\cdot H_{odd}$ be a rerandomization of $C^*_{sk}$. 
(Not necessarily permissible.)
- Let $tx = v \cdot G_{value} + r_v \cdot H_{even}$ be a commitment to the value of the coin $v$. 
(Also not necessarily permissible.)
- Prove $v$ has appropiate range and balance with outher inputs/outputs.
- Send $(tx, C^*_{sk})$ to the network.

The network:
1. verifies $tx$ with the rest of the inputs and outputs. 
2. computes a hash of tx into the scalar field of $E_{odd}$: $H(tx)$.
3. homomorphically adds $H(tx)$ to $C^*_{sk}$ and then adds $H_{odd}$ until the result is permissible, obtaining $C_{sk+H(tx)}$. I.e:
$$C_{sk+H(tx)}=C^*_{sk}+[H(tx)]\cdot G + r_{permissible} \cdot H_{odd}$$
4. adds the $x$-coordinate of $C_{sk+H(tx)}$ to $tx$ (using the $G_{PRF}$ generator) and then adds $H_{even}$ until the result is permissible, obtaining $tx'$. Where $tx' = tx + [C_{sk+H(tx)}.x] \cdot G_{PRF} + [r_{permissible}'] \cdot H_{even}$.
5. add the $x$-coordinate of $tx'$ to the curve tree.

When the receiver gets passed $r_{rerandomization}$, $v$, and $r_v$ it can (based on the transaction and its private state) compute the opening of:
- $C_{sk+H(tx)} = [sk + H(tx)] \cdot G + [r_{sk} + r_{rerandomization} + r_{permissible}]\cdot H_{odd}$.
- $tx' = [v] \cdot G_{value} + [C_{sk+H(tx)}.x] \cdot G_{PRF} + [r_v + r_{permissible}'] \cdot H_{even}$.

### Spending
Assume a prover knows the opening of a coin $tx'$ as described above.

The prover:
1. Computes the tag $t = [(sk + H(tx))^{-1}] \cdot G$.
2. Selects and rerandomizes $tx'$ as $tx^* = tx' + [r_{coin}] \cdot H_{even}$ from the curve tree.
3. It then selects and rerandomizes "with fixed index" $C_{sk+H(tx)}$ as $C^*_{sk+H(tx)} = C_{sk+H(tx)} + [r_{t}] \cdot H_{odd}$  from $tx^*$.
3. Proves that $C^*_{sk+H(tx)} = [x] \cdot G + [r^*] \cdot H_{odd} \land [x^{-1}] \cdot G = t$. Only revealing $t$.
Concretely:
    - show opening of commitment $C^*_{sk+H(tx)}$ obtaining variable for $x$
    - treat $t$ as a commitment (not vector) with randomness zero, show opening, obtaining variable for $x^{-1}$ and constrain $x\cdot x^{-1}-1 = 0$.
